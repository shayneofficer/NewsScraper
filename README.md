# NewsScraper

## About
This app scrapes the Crain's Business Chicago website for article headlines, summaries, and links. These data are then displayed on the home page in cards which have buttons to save the article or add a note to it. Saved articles can then be viewed by clicking the "saved articles" button in the navbar. All articles and notes can be removed by pressing the "clear articles" button in the navbar. On an empty page the app will alert that no articles are available, either on the home page or on the saved articles page, and suggest viewing the other page. By pressing the "scape articles" button, the server will repeat its scape of Crain's and display the scraped info. 

## TODO
- Add delete buttons to remove individual notes.
- Check database before scraping so duplicate articles aren't stored.
